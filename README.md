# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Project
<p align="justify">The purpose of this analysis is to write Python scripts and perform an analysis in order to help PyBer, a ride sharing app company, to improve access their services. 
Also, an objective with this project is to determine the affordability for underserved neighborhoods as well as to give the CEO of PyBer business recommendations.</p> 

## Results
<p align="justify">In this analysis we were comparing 3 types of cities: Urban, Rural, and Suburban, and we will be considering the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver of each city. 
With the data that is in the table below *(first image)* we can describe the differences in the data between the types of cities.</p>

### Total Rides

<p align="justify">First of all, it is clear that there are a higher number of rides in urban cities, than in suburban and rural places. However, the rural cities have a lower number of rides than the suburban ones. The rural cities have a total of 125 rides, which means that urban cities have 1500 rides more than the rural. On the other hand, the suburban cities have a total of 625 rides, 1000 rides less than the urban cities.</p>

### Total Drivers

<p align="justify">With the information described above we can infer that there are more drivers in urban areas, than in suburban and rural areas. The rural cities have the least number of drivers, with a total of 78. This can be considered a small number of drivers since in urban cities there are 2327 more drivers than in rural ones.</p> 

### Total Fare and Average Fare per Ride

<p align="justify">The fare per ride coincided with the number of rides each city has, meaning that the total fare is lower in rural cities than in urban or suburban cities. Even though the total fares correspond to the total number of rides or each city, the average fare per ride is higher in rural areas than in urban ones. On average, the fare per ride in urban cities is of $24.53, in Suburban and Rural cities is of $30.97 and $34.62 respectively. 
This statement is also backed up with the line chart shown below, where it is displayed the relationship between the *Total Fares* and the *Months* of January through April. *(second image)*</p>

### Average Fare per Driver

<p align="justify">When it comes to the average fare per driver the urban cities have the lowest average fare, followed by the suburban ones, therefore making the rural cities the areas with the highest average fare. 
The average fare per driver in rural cities is of $55.49, in the suburban ones the average is of $39.50, and in the urban ones of $16.57.</p>

## Summary

<p align="justify">Based on the results mentioned above we can draw certain conclusions that can potentially help the PyBer company to improve access to ride sharing services in underserved areas as well as to generate more profit.</p> 

<p align="justify">The first recommendation is to set the fares per ride in urban areas at a lower price to increase the total number of rides. This could be beneficial in the long term because it could cause an increase in the total fares in urban cities.</p> 

<p align="justify">The second recommendation would be to increase the number of drivers in rural cities in order to increase the number of rides. If this were to happen the company would have a bigger profit, since the total fares would increase. Therefore, there would be an improvement in the access that people in rural cities have to this ride sharing service.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, the last recommendation is to decrease the number of drivers in urban cities since this number is higher than the number of rides. This means that there are a lot of drivers that are not generating any profit. By doing this last recommendation the rides as well as the total amount of fares could increase.</p>
